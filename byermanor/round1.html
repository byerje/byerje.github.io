        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>There are <span class="highlight">eight rooms</span>, each with one type of puzzle to solve.</li>
            <li>Each team can have <span class="highlight">one puzzle sheet per room</span> (no more).</li>
            <li>Teams must <span class="highlight">stick together</span> and solve the <b>same</b> puzzle.</li>
            <li>For the <b>metal disentanglement puzzles</b>, if you are familiar with one, choose one you haven’t solved before, to make it fair for everyone. Take a picture of the completed puzzle and then put it back how you found it. Then show the picture you took to the Key Master.</li>
            <li>Each time you solve a puzzle, send one person down to the Key Master with the solved puzzle to scan a clue.</li>
            <li>Scanning a clue's QR code with your phone adds it to your clue sheet, or "hand".</li>
            <li>Look at your clue sheet to see (1)all the cards that have been checked off your list and (2) all discovered motives.</li>
            <li>The next puzzle cannot be started until <span class="highlight">both people are back together</span> and ready to move to the next room.</li>
            <li>If you run into <span class="highlight">other teams</span>, you must do your assigned interactions and hear theirs.</li>
            <li>Round 1 will end after every room's puzzle has been solved at least once by a team, even if your team has not completed all the puzzles in all the rooms.</li>
            <li>The team who finds the <b>most clues</b> will be rewarded.</li>
            <li>A reward will also be given for a team that finds the <span class="highlight">5 tokens AND figurine</span> of their color.</li>
        </ul>
