            <p class="character-name">Ms. Scarlet:</p>
            <p>It’s heartbreaking what happened to Ms. Body. But Mrs. Green’s habit of sneaking around has always made me suspicious. I hope justice is served, but I had nothing to do with it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Mr. Scarlet:</p>
            <p>The loss of Ms. Body is truly devastating. That said, Madam Mustard’s long history of making enemies on her travels cannot be ignored. Me? I just write stories, not tragedies like this.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Mrs. Green:</p>
            <p>Ms. Body didn’t deserve this—such a terrible loss. But let’s not forget Ms. Scarlet’s notorious temper and her past confrontations with Ms. Body. I’m as shaken as anyone, but I’m no suspect.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Mr. Green:</p>
            <p>How tragic for Ms. Body to meet such an untimely end. Still, the late Lord Peacock’s secretive past makes me uneasy. But I’m not involved—I could never harm anyone.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Lord Peacock:</p>
            <p>The death of Ms. Body is nothing short of a tragedy. But Dr. Orchid’s research into poisons feels far too convenient in this situation. Me? I have nothing to hide.</p>
        </div>        
        <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Lady Peacock:</p>
            <p>It’s such a terrible loss for the community. Ms. Body deserved a brighter future. But Madam Mahogany’s dealings have always raised eyebrows. If anyone knew too much about her business, it was Ms. Body. I’m grieving like the rest of you.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Professor Plum:</p>
            <p>Ms. Body’s death is deeply upsetting. I can’t help but think about Mrs. White’s temper—it’s no secret she had issues with Ms. Body. But I would never hurt anyone. This situation is horrifying.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Lady Plum:</p>
            <p>I can’t stop thinking about the tragedy of Ms. Body. She had so much ahead of her. But the lady Professor Orchid’s work with toxins makes her a questionable figure in all this. I study history, not harm.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Dr. Orchid:</p>
            <p>Ms. Body’s death weighs heavily on all of us. But Professor Plum’s experiments have caused accidents before—who’s to say this wasn’t another one? My work is always controlled and ethical.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Professor Orchid:</p>
            <p>What happened to Ms. Body is beyond tragic. Mr. Scarlet’s eerie ability to write murder plots that feel so real is troubling. I only study plants—I could never be part of something like this.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Madam Mustard:</p>
            <p>Ms. Body’s death is heartbreaking—I can’t imagine the pain her loved ones are feeling. But Ms. Scarlet’s dramatic outbursts have always seemed suspicious. I’d never hurt anyone.</p>
        </div>
         <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Colonel Mustard:</p>
            <p>The loss of Ms. Body is such a tragedy. But Mrs. Green’s sneaky behavior lately feels off to me. I’d never want to cause harm if possible — I’m just as shaken as anyone else.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Mrs. White:</p>
            <p>What happened to Ms. Body is truly devastating. Lady Plum’s fascination with poisons feels a little too relevant here, though. I’ve had disagreements in the past, but I’d never stoop to this.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Dr. White:</p>
            <p>The tragic end of Ms. Body is something I can’t stop thinking about. Mr. Green’s questionable business dealings make me wonder if she knew something she shouldn’t have. I’ve made mistakes, but nothing like this.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Madam Mahogany:</p>
            <p>Ms. Body’s death is a loss for us all. But Lady Peacock’s penchant for collecting secrets might have led to something terrible. I have nothing to hide—I’m just here to mourn and seek the truth.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Mr. Mahogany:</p>
            <p>The passing of Ms. Body is deeply tragic. The late Lord Peacock’s mysterious history leaves a lot of unanswered questions, though. I could never harm anyone—I just deal in rare items.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Inspector Noir:</p>
            <p>The untimely death of Ms. Body is a blow to the entire community. Madam Noir’s past investigations have uncovered dangerous truths before—did they uncover something too close to home? I’m here to find justice, not hide secrets.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Madam Noir:</p>
            <p>Ms. Body’s story ended far too soon, and it’s unbearable to think about. But Inspector Noir’s eagerness to gather us all raises questions. I expose the truth—I don’t create tragedy.</p>
