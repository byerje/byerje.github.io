        <h1>Round 1</h1>
        <p>
            The goal of this round is to solve puzzles hidden throughout the mansion to earn clues. Players will explore eight guest rooms, each containing a specific type of puzzle to challenge their wit and teamwork. Once a puzzle is solved, show it to the Key Master and your team will be rewarded with valuable clues that will help unravel the mystery. Hurry! There are only so many clues to be given out. Quick thinking, strategy, and cooperation are essential, as the limited number of clues makes every moment count. Stay focused, work together, and navigate the twists and turns of the mansion to edge closer to solving the murder!</p>
